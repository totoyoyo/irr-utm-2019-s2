Dion's lecture goes in here.
% It all goes within a single section, so begin with a \subsection{...}, not a \section{...}
% Don't try to compile this file alone, instead compile GITREPO/master/student-lecture-all or GITREPO/master/student-lecture-dion
% which input this file.
% You should not add the latex head to this file, just start writing as if you already have a \section{...} in the line above line 1.
% Do NOT write \end{document} at the end.
